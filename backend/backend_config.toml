# Override verification method to use for each email provider. Each email provider can
# be verified using one of the following methods:
# - Gmail: smtp
# - Hotmail B2B: smtp
# - Hotmail B2C: headless or smtp
# - Yahoo: headless or smtp
# - Mimecast: smtp
# - Proofpoint: smtp
#
# For the email providers you choose to verify using the "smtp" method, you
# may add additional configuration, such as hello_name, from_email, and
# whether to use a proxy or not.
#
# If using proxies, the list of proxies must be defined in the "proxies"
# section below, with a unique name for each proxy such as "proxy1", "proxy2",
# etc. Then, in the email provider's SMTP configuration, set the value to the
# name of the proxy to use. To use the proxy defined the the top-level "proxy"
# section, set the value to "default".
[overrides]
# Use the "proxies" configuration below to route SMTP verification requests
# through a specified proxy.
#
# Reacher allows you to configure multiple proxies, each with a unique name.
# We recommend simply using "proxy1", "proxy2", etc. as the proxy names.
#
# In the `overrides` section below, you can specify which proxy to use for
# each email provider. For example, to use "proxy1" for Gmail and "proxy2" for
# Yahoo, set the `gmail` field to "proxy1" and the `yahoo` field to "proxy2".

# Configuration for a queue-based architecture for Reacher. This feature is
# currently in **beta**. The queue-based architecture allows Reacher to scale
# horizontally by running multiple workers that consume emails from a RabbitMQ
# queue.
#
# To enable the queue-based architecture, set the "enable" field to "true" and
# configure the RabbitMQ connection below. The "concurrency" field specifies
# the number of concurrent emails to verify for this worker.
#
# For more information, see the documentation at:
# https://docs.reacher.email/self-hosting/scaling-for-production

#
# If you wish to store additional data along with the verification results,
