# Database and Migrations

## Migrations

All migrations in this folder are embedded directly in the `reacher_backend` binary, so you don't need to run the migrations manually.

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced usage (such as reverting to an old state), please use the `sqlx` CLI command.

See https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-cli/README.md
